#IRCapp (code by MrJ, design by Schickele)

##IRCapp is a small highly user friendly, cross-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac) download application for those who don't have the time to bother.

#Installation
Download at : <https://sourceforge.net/projects/ircapp/files/>

##Windows
Simply download and execute the setup.exe file

##Unix
There are currently two .deb files available.

*   FULL Version :  
    Use this version if you do not program python and didn't install any of the following packages (this is the dependency list):      
    *   irc
    *   requests
    *   cherrypy
    *   django
    *   pytz
    
    If you have these packages, there might be an error during the installation (file overwrite).
    Install with:          
        sudo dpkg -i IRCapp_1.1_full.deb

*   MIN Version :  
    Use this version in any other case. To install, run:          
        sudo apt-get install python3-pip
        sudo pip3 install django irc requests cherrypy pytz
        sudo dpkg -i IRCapp_1.1_min.deb
        
##OSX
I'm currently trying to get a Mac and will create a Mac distribution ASAP !

###To do's
This is the first stable open-beta version (1.1).  
As such, a few major things still need to be done:  
*   Add OSX distribution
*   Clean up the code and add documentation (didn't really have the time...)
*   Add SSL support
